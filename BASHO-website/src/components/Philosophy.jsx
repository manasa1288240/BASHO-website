          From formless clay, a story grows, through hands that shape, the spirit flows. A wheel that turns, a heart that sings, crafting life in simple things.
          <br/>
          <b>Break to bloom</b> - Clay bends, it breaks, yet forms anew, a craft of hands, both strong and true from each reform, its beauty shines, a timeless art in crafted lines.
